	/* This file tells Scarves how to turn items into fabric squares.
	 *
	 * The keys are item Identifiers - if Scarves sees a valid listing for an item, the Scarf Stapler and Scarf Serger
	 * will accept them as fabric-square inputs. In this file, all of the inputs are things like "minecraft:white_wool",
	 * and if the namespace is left out, "minecraft" is implied. So namespaces are skipped here so that it's easier to read.
	 *
	 * This file uses a combination of "simple" and "full" descriptions. Using a full json object, you have full control
	 * over every adjustable aspect of the square.
	 *
	 * - "texture" MUST be an Identifier for a texture in the blocks/items atlas.
	 *
	 * - "x" and "y" are offsets into the texture. "4,4" will cause the 8px by 8px fabric square to use the middle of the
	 *   texture. "0,0" will use the top left. "4, 8" will use the bottom middle. Any coordinates over 8 will cause
	 *   unusual texture atlas spill.
	 *
	 * - "color" will tint the texture. If you don't want to tint, use "#FFF" or skip the key.
	 *
	 * - "color_hint" affects the color which appears on the scarf item in guis.
	 *
	 * - "emissive" makes the scarf render bright in dark areas, and may in some shaders cause it to really glow.
